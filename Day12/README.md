1) Enter your age and verify your aligible or not for election voting using if else condition.

2) Ternary Operator

3) Switch Case
Example1: Enter the value between 1 to 7 and create a program for following output
Enter the number between 1 to 7: 1
Today is Sunday!

4) Example2:
Write a code for small astrology based on your life path number for that get date of from user then calculate life path number.(Use switch case)
	Example:
		Date: 23
		
		calculation for life path number:
			a=date%10	3
			b=date/10	2
			c=a+b 		5
		
		 if life path number :
		   1.Lucky 
		   2.Carefuly do your work
		   3.Storger
		   4.Happy
		   5.Can get help
		   6.Doubt
		   7.sad
		   8.Like
		   9.Courage
	
5) Example3:
Give list of numbers then calculate the summation and multiplication using for loop.
	Example:
		1 2 3 4 5
		summation = 15
		multiplication = 120
		
6) Example4:
Print the intergers from 1 to 10 using while loop

7) Example5:
Write a C program to generate and print the Fibonacci series up to a specified number of terms.The program should take the number of terms as input from the user and then display the corresponding Fibonacci sequence.

8) Example6:
Write a C program to calculate the factorial of a given non-negetive interger

9) Example7:
Write a C program that:
Accept two string as input from the user.
Concatenates the two string displays the concatenated result

10) Example 8:
Write a C program that takes a binary number (as an integer) as input and 
converts it to its decimal equivalent.

11) Example9:
Write a C program that:
Accepts an array of integers from the user.
Finds and displays the maximum and minimum values in the array.

12) Example 10:
C program to generate Pascal's Triangle.
